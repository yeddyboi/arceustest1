Small explenation on files and directories.

Directories needed:
c2, bot

inside of the c2 folder you will need the following folders.
scripts, logs, amp, 

inside of the amp folder you will need the following folders.
methods, lists, scanners

inside of the methods folder you will need the following folders.
Bandwidth, Reflection

for the (amp) folder, the install.py should set it up on its own and make all of the directories for such on its own.


files needed inside of (bot) folder.
bot.c Arceus.py
==================================================
Files needed inside of (c2) folder.
Arceus.c, arceus.txt, install.py, resolver.h
==================================================
Files needed inside of (c2/scripts) folder.
IPHM_Attack_Process_Killer.py, IPHM_Scanner_Process_Killer.py, scan.py

if this helps < here ya go
mkdir c2; mkdir bot; cd c2; mkdir logs; mkdir scripts
==================================================
the "resolver.h" is a C-Header and is included whithin the c2 source itself. THIS IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPILE SAID FILE.
the "install.py" is the IPHM Script installer, this is needed in the c2 directory. mainly because since we are inside of the c2 dir
we can not push back to run things, and it would make it impossible to run the files off of the c2, so we have to call to the
amp/methods/ folder inside of the c2 dir. 
the "arcues.txt" is our login file. should look like this: Jack root admin || Input: <Username> <Password> <Level> || levels="admin","normal","vip"
the "IPHM_Attack_Process_Killer.py" is our IPHM Process killer. just makes it easier to kill shit.
the "IPHM_Scanner_Process_Killer.py" is our IPHM Scanner process killer. just makes it easier to kill shit.
the "scan.py" is our SSH Scanner. scans IP Blocks AutoMatically. pretty dank.
