                      Another project me and jack have decided take on after a break of coding project 'Katura'
                      This new project is designed to fulfil the potential of a C2 source, outcompeting other C2 sources.
                      We have decided to try to recreate this source into such a tool where it will completely put
                      'Mirai' RCE-WGET exploitation to complete shame. 

                      This will be a continuous and ongoing project. We are hoping to soon create this into something that
                      exceeds the capabilities that are set by other developers creating such 'cyber-warfare' tools 
                      as this.

                      ---

                      Both me and Jack, Have the certain capabilities to create something so unique and better, through
                      the use of combined networking and programming knowledge.

                      This is a challenge both me and Jack, have decided to take on.

                      Till next time.
